Copyconstructor:
Creating new object using the existing object
It does not have return type
We can use Initializer list
We cannot copy same object(obj=obj),Compiler throws Error "Redeclaration of object"

AssignmentOperator:
Assigning one existing object with the other existing object
It has return type[obect by reference]
We cannot use Initializer list
We can assign same object(obj=obj),Works fine

NOTE:
Due to obj=obj, Memory gets wasted 
To avoid this,We can use Self Assignment Check condition(if this != &obj)
